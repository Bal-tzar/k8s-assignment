# Kubernetes assignment

For this assignment we are tasked with writing about the fundamental components in a K8s cluster, and describe what the different components are doing. We are to do the same with the most common objects (kind:) in a k8s cluster. 


There should be a description for how one can administrate a k8s cluster locally and in the cloud. 

The last part of the assignment is developing a simple app and deploying it in a k8s cluster in the cloud: 
  - Describe the design of the application
  - How is the k8s manifesto defined
  - How is security handled in the k8s cluster
  - How the app is deployed
